# Tic Tac Toe Game – React Learning

This is a simple and interactive **Tic Tac Toe** game built using **React.js** as part of my React learning journey.

## Features
- Two-player game with a 3x3 grid.
- Dynamic rendering using React components.
- State management with React hooks (`useState`).
- Game logic to determine a **winner** or a **draw**.
- Responsive UI with icons representing player moves.
- Easy-to-understand and modular code.

## Demo
You can try the game live [here](#) *(replace # with your deployed link if available).*

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe.git
How to Play

Player X and Player O take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid.

The first player to get three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins.

If all nine squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game is a draw.

I can also make a **more compact, GitHub-friendly version** with badges and a screenshot section that looks professional on your repo.  

Do you want me to do that?
